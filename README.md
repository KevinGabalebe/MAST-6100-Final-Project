This repository contains all files for my Machine Learning and Deep Learning Final Project, where I compare 4 different models abilities to identify whether a song is danceable or not.

The project investigates:
1. How accurately can audio features classify danceable songs?
2. Which musical attributes are most strongly associated with danceability?
3. How wel modern models distinguish between danceable and non-danceable tracks in comparison to classical statistical approaches?

The project models using:
- Logistic Regression
- Radial Support Vector Machines
- Single-Layer Neural Network
- H2O Deep Learning Framework

The reporisitory contains:
- Spotify Track Dataset with 32833 songs and 23 columns downloaded from Kaggle
- All plots generated by R used in the project
- The 5 slide presentation
- A 10 page report on my findings (12 pages if including Table of Contents and Title Page)

The code was written using Rmarkdown on:
-RStudio Version 2025.09.1+401
